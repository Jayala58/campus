# Campus Placement Tracking API
Minimal scaffold for the Campus Placement Tracking backend project.
- Node.js + Express + MongoDB (Mongoose)
- JWT auth, role-based middleware
- Multer + Cloudinary upload helper
- Basic models: User, Student, Company, Drive, Offer
- Reports controllers (aggregation examples)

Steps:
1. copy `.env.example` -> `.env` and set values
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

This scaffold is intentionally minimal but runnable after filling env vars.
